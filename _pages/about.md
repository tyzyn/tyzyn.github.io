I am a Data Scientist at [glass.ai](http://glass.ai), focusing on natural language processing and machine learning. My responsibilities encompass client-oriented projects for entities such as [Ipsos](https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk), [UKRI](https://www.ukri.org/), and the [Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-digital-culture-media-sport). In my role, I contribute to the development of algorithms for company discovery, classification, and growth signal detection from web scraped content.

Previously I've been a Software Engineer at [JPMorgan Chase & Co](https://www.jpmorgan.com/) building dashboards with [kdb+](https://code.kx.com/q/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

Prior to this, I graduated with a Distinction in MSc Data Science from the [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/). My supervisor was [Hywel Williams](https://computerscience.exeter.ac.uk/staff/htpw201) and for my thesis I looked at the feasibility of electoral prediction using socially generated data, using Twitter as a case study. I completed my BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics also at the University of Exeter.
